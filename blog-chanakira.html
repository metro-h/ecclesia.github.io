										<h4>Introduction</h4>
										<p>
											The earliest archeologically 
identified Christian church 
is a house church (‘domus 
ecclesiae’), the Dura-Europos 
church, in Syria and interestingly 
it has the oldest surviving church 
building in the world. 
It was founded between 233 and 
256 AD. Jerusalem was the centre 
of the Christian movement, at least 
until its destruction by Roman 
armies in AD 70, but from this 
centre, Christianity radiated to 
other cities and towns in Palestine 
and beyond. 
In the second half of the 3rd 
century AD, the first purpose-built 
halls for Christian worship (‘aula 
ecclesiae’) began to be constructed 
and subsequently in its different 
denominations e.g. Protestants, Independents, Anglican, Catholics, 
Orthodox, Marginal, Unaffiliated, 
“the Church” has grown and been 
sustained till now on the world’s six 
continents. 
It takes a great sense of stewardship 
and sustainability to have been able 
to perpetuate this great institution 
for centuries. The church is therefore 
one of the oldest institutions in the 
world and how it has been sustained 
and maintained should be a subject 
of great interest to us.	</p>
                                            
											
										
											
	<p>My pastor, Tom Deuschle, 
        founder of Celebration Ministries 
        International (founded in Harare, 
        Zimbabwe) who chairs the board 
        that I have had the privilege to 
        serve for the past decade, has often 
        remarked that “it is easy to build 
        a church building but it is more 
        difficult to maintain it.” There have 
        been and are still various local and 
        global forces that are militating against the sustenance of the Church 
        but in light of the great commission 
        contained in Mark 16:15, the 
        discipling challenge in Matthew 
        28:18-20, the teaching challenge of 
        Luke 24, the mission challenge of 
        John 20:21 and the global challenge 
        of Acts 1:8, we have to be extremely 
        careful to be stewards of His Church 
        to not only sustain but grow it until 
        Jesus Christ returns. 
        Let me begin by making a couple 
        of definitions on the subject at 
        hand before I share my research, 
        experiences, reflections and 
        conclude from these. Stewardship 
        is “the careful and responsible 
        management of something 
        entrusted to one’s care.” It is 
        the conducting, supervising, or 
        managing of something valuable. A 
        steward owns nothing but manages everything. We truly are all stewards here on earth because His Word 
        (the Bible) states “the earth is the Lord’s and all it contains.” Therefore, 
        in the context of the Church, He owns it and we are here to manage it as 
        stewards. But a more crucial issue to be considered is, “are we doing a good 
        job with managing His Church?” The Church’s sustenance and strength 
        judged by its growth and fulfilment of its mandate would be probably be 
        the best way to make a judgement call. Sustainability is most often defined 
        as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of 
        future generations to meet theirs. 
			</p>

            <p>
                I have had the privilege of having been ministered to around two broad 
categories of churches, namely the big old traditional western churches 
(namely Roman Catholic Church) and the new emerging evangelical 
churches. These two broad categories of churches offer interesting contrasts 
in terms of the stewardship and sustenance. I will begin with looking at 
the impressive and seemingly sustainable Roman Catholic Church (RCC) 
model and compare it with the smaller emerging local evangelical and 
Pentecostal churches that I am more familiar within my beloved nation of 
Zimbabwe. Hopefully we can learn something from this exercise.
I was born in 1966 in a Zimbabwean Methodist home where we keenly 
attended church and my parents we active members involved in supporting 
the Church. I then attended Roman Catholic Church (RCC) nursery, 
primary and secondary schools in the 70’s and 80’s where I took my 
religious studies carefully and even served in church albeit, I never was 
baptised as a Catholic. I then was exposed to the Anglican Church through 
visiting relatives and friends across cities in beautiful Zimbabwe and I was 
exposed to the majestic Catholic and Anglican cathedrals. I was always awed 
and overwhelmed by the wealth reflected by the colourful glass windows 
glimmering in the sunshine and the regal artworks of these traditional 
western churches. 
My curious financial mind often questioned how these churches and 
cathedrals had come to be built and how they would be sustained given 
their very western roots post our 1980 Independence and its leaning to 
communism and the East. Clearly some of these churches continued to 
receive some form of support and subsidies from the parent churches 
overseas I assumed. I can also testify to witnessing some of the new local 
traditional Methodist, Catholic and Anglican churches being built with 
local funds that were subsidized by donations from overseas. The older I 
grew up and as a professional investment banker I often wondered “how 
did the RCC for example become such significant owners of magnificent 
properties?

                                        <p>  Take where I grew up in the 1960’s as an example of how the RCC has 
                                            accumulated asset worth. My neighbourhood was a blue collar workers 
                                            township enclave in the city of Harare. People weren’t poverty stricken but 
                                            certainly were a long way from being wealthy. My Catholic nursery school 
                                            was allocated land within the township which the RCC paid for over time and they built the school and a small 
                                            cathedral. A hundred years ago the 
                                            land was cheap but now the land 
                                            upon which it sits is worth several 
                                            hundred thousand dollars. This 
                                            scenario is repeated everywhere 
                                            in Zimbabwe at the primary and 
                                            secondary schools that I attended. 
                                            In both instances farmland was 
                                            acquired about a century ago and 
                                            this is commonplace elsewhere in 
                                            the world. The Church just had to 
                                            stay in a place for long enough and 
                                            its properties just kept growing in 
                                            value. This of course is not a lot of 
                                            use unless they need a loan and put 
                                            a property up for collateral. The 
                                            Church often can’t sell the property 
                                            because it needs them for ongoing 
                                            purposes, and there is nowhere else 
                                            to go (which is why property values 
                                            keep climbing). Also, worldwide 
                                            the RCC has accumulated gifts that 
                                            weren’t expensive when given, are 
                                            now collector’s items and worth a 
                                            lot of money. This classic model 
                                            remains the same today for churches 
                                            to acquire land from local authorities 
                                            through time, build facilities and in 
                                            the course of time these appreciate 
                                            in value thereby increasing the net 
                                            worth of churches.                                                   
</p>
<p>From a global viewpoint, the RCC 
    is the oldest contiguous Christian 
    community in the world. It currently 
    has in excess of 1.3 billion adherents 
    bearing in mind that the earth has 
    a population of 7 Billion occupants. 
    The RCC has been around for at least 
    1500 years as a social institution 
    since the fall of the Roman Empire. 
    In that time period it has received 
    endowments from deceased estates 
    which it used to build hospitals, 
    schools, aged care facilities & 
    churches, and allowed this Church 
    to finance missions throughout the 
    world and no doubt that Southern 
    Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) was one such a beneficiary. As a consequence 
    the RCC is said to be asset rich but 
    liquidity poor (little cash). The RCC 
    will normally state that it isn’t rich 
    and self-sustaining as such, it just 
    has a lot of ancient assets that are 
    on paper worth a lot of money, but 
    realistically, because they are still 
    in use, can’t be sold and can’t be 
    readily replaced. 
    From various sources on the 
    internet, I learned that the RCC is 
    the richest religious organization in 
    the world, followed by the Mormon 
    Church. The RCC is divided into; 
    Catholic Church Vatican, Catholic 
    Church Australia and Catholic 
    church Germany. All the subbranches independently make it 
    to our list of top ten wealthiest 
    churches in the world. The total 
    net worth of the Catholic churches 
    is the sum of all worth from the 
    above-mentioned countries. I learnt 
    that in different nations globally 
    they have church-owned properties, 
    including churches, presbyteries, 
    schools, nursing homes, hospitals, 
    offices, tennis courts, art collections, 
    gold and even mobile phone 
    towers. But beyond real estate, 
    there was superannuation funds, 
    telecommunications investments, 
    Catholic Church Insurance and 
    Catholic Development Funds, 
    which serve as an internal treasury 
    for their sustenance. The RCC also 
    gets its money much the same 
    way that any other church gets 
    money i.e. from parishioners, 
    rents, and investments. Catholics 
    for Renewal's, Peter Johnstone, a 
    corporate governance consultant, 
    said most Catholics would have no 
    idea about the extent of the church's 
    assets because they tend to be 
    conservatively valued at historical 
    costs and are rarely ever marked to 
    market. There is no doubt, however, 
    that between the church's priceless 
    art, land, gold and investments across the globe, it is one of the 
    wealthiest institutions on Earth.</p>

									
<p>
    Since 313 A.D., when Catholicism 
    became the official religion of the 
    Roman Empire, its power has been 
    in near-constant growth. Bankers' 
    best guesses about the Vatican's 
    wealth put it at US$10 billion to 
    US$15 billion (bn). Of this wealth, 
    Italian stockholdings alone run 
    to US$1.6 bn, 15% of the value of 
    listed shares on the Italian market. 
    The Vatican has big investments in 
    banking e.g. Vatican Bank valued at 
    US$3, 2 bn, insurance, chemicals, 
    steel, construction, & real estate. 
    The Vatican is one of the most 
    religious and richest states around 
    the world. The place is a pilgrimage 
    for Roman Catholics, which makes 
    it the cynosure of wealth and riches. 
    It is difficult to estimate its worth, 
    but statistics suggest that the state 
    is worth around US$15 bn. It is 
    astonishing for such a small state 
    with this low population to hike up 
    to that magnificent worth. The citystate owns valuable assets, which 
    make it the centre of attraction for 
    tourists and add up to its value. 
    The venerable church attracts more 
    people than the city-state itself. 
    The magnificent infrastructure 
    of various churches and chapels 
    in the state is nowhere else to be 
    found. The St. Peter’s Basilica is the 
    world’s largest basilica. It forms the 
    centrepiece of the Vatican, where 
    St. Peter was buried. Moreover, 
    the Sistine Chapel, built by Pope 
    Sixtus IV in 1473-84, augments the 
    beauty of the state. Moreover, the 
    Vatican holds valuable artwork by revered artists like Michelangelo 
    and Raphael. The price of the 
    artwork increases with time. Hence, 
    the worth of the Vatican is on an 
    unimpeded growth. Some of these 
    works are considered “priceless.” 
    Ironically, they add up the most to 
    the value. 
    Additionally, the Vatican City has 
    a number of investments from 
    foreign and native investors. It owns 
    shares worth billions. Some of the 
    investment giants are Gulf oil, Shell, 
    General Electric, etc. This makes it 
    a significant hub for business along 
    with its divine aroma, which results 
    in a meteoric increase in wealth. 
    The wealth of the Catholic Church 
    includes valuable items such gold 
    – often found in ceremonial items, 
    church furnishings and artworks 
    – is something that was amassed 
    through the efforts of religious 
    individuals and clergy who built 
    cathedrals and churches, furnished 
    them, and dedicated it all to the 
    glorification of God.

                                    Obviously depending on the 
RCC religious order and country, 
Diocesan priests may draw a taxable 
salary (at times required by labour 
laws in various countries). Those 
involved in charitable institutions 
(hospitals, schools aged care etc.) 
are generally exempt from labour 
laws, and usually don’t receive a 
salary, just a stipend as mentioned. 
Its clergy do not receive a salary per 
se, often just a room to sleep in, food 
in the belly and a small stipend to 
buy essential personal items. This 
has been so over centuries as this church maintains that it has got 
just enough cash flow (money) to 
support its millions of clergy and 
upkeep its buildings and charities. 
The RCC gives more than anyone to 
feed world hunger regardless of their 
religion, it is the largest charitable 
organization in the world. They 
house the homeless, have Pantries, 
and shelters. Catholic Charities have 
provided food, clothing, shelter and 
a network of support services to 
people of all ages and from all walks 
of life and religious backgrounds. 
St. Jude's, and America's Second 
Harvest alone total US$5,57bn 
which is greater than number one 
on the list for America. Keep going 
down the list and you find Father 
Flanagan's homes, Catholic Medical 
Mission Board, Covenant House, 
and more. Add the thousands of 
other charities, from Missionaries 
to the Poor, Amigos for Christ, 
soup kitchens, homeless shelters, to 
religious orders (like Missionaries 
of Charity) and thousands upon 
thousands of individual parishes 
across the globe who often do their 
work in anonymity, and you will see 
some of the charitable works of the 
Catholic Church. Catholic Priests in 
the US live very modest lives making 
$ 25,000–$30,000 a year, and live 
in parish rectories. Compared to the 
Mormon Church who state they have 
no paid clergy, general authorities’ 
salaries increased from $116,400 
to $120,000. In 1996, with homes 
in the US$1 million dollar range. 
Some religions feed only their own 
hungry, the Catholic Church feeds 
all of the hungry regardless of their 
religion. And that’s exactly how God will separate the sheep from 
the goats, by the love that they have 
for their fellow mankind, God’s 
sheep feed everyone especially the 
unbelievers in hopes a few may 
follow, where the goats were selfish 
and fed only their own. I tell you 
the truth, when you refused to help 
the least of these, my brothers and 
sisters, you were refusing to help me 
(Matthew 25:45)

                                            I also took an interest in the Church 
                                            of England from whence came

                                            prevalent where I grew up. This 
                                            church is also asset rich but is facing 
                                            a decline in active church members, 
                                            an attendant decrease in income, 
                                            while the costs stay the same or 
                                            rise. Solution strategies focus on 
                                            improving the occupancy rate of the 
                                            buildings through multifunctional 
                                            use or finding alternative housing, 
                                            taking the current church building 
                                            out of service. Overseas hundreds of 
                                            their clergy are in financial hardship, 
                                            with some resorting to credit cards or 
                                            even a high-interest payday lender, 
                                            despite the Church of England

								<h4> Conclusion</h4>
								<p>
									I would like to close off my 
reflections on the subject matter on 
the subject of emerging evangelical 
and Pentecostal churches in 
Zimbabwe and their sustainability. 
Interestingly Dr Judith Mwenje, a prolific researcher in the area in one 
of her papers states “Pentecostal 
churches in Zimbabwe are growing 
at a fast rate and [their] growth 
strategies are of paramount 
importance. A number of strategies 
are employed by individual churches 
at a different rate. The rate at which 
a certain strategy is used determines 
the growth of the church in terms of 
numerical growth, financial growth 
and spiritual growth. The main 
growth strategy that Pentecostal 
churches in Zimbabwe use is that 
of evangelism, healing and care 
ministry.” As a result we have seen 
rapid growth of these churches 
at rates that have surpassed the 
traditional churches of western 
origin. The biggest such church for 
example has managed to establish 
three schools, a hospital and a 
private university and this is most 
commendable considering the 
number of years of existence. Such 
churches reflect that the African 
churches have been fast learners of 
sustainable practices together with 
the steady accumulation of assets 
and growing membership</p>
