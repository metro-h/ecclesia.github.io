										<h4>Introduction</h4>
										<p>
											Simply put, to retire is leaving one's job and
stopping to work. This can be by free choice or
forced by the law and other circumstances.
Some employers stipulate that one must retire
when they reach age of 65, some 60 and
others 55 for early retirement.
If you enter the labour market, prepare to exit
as well. One day you will retire, either through
legislation limits, age, health challenges,
disability, and retrenchment among other
causes.
One reality many are trying to disrupt and
deny is that every living organism that is born
will grow, wax strong, achieve peak
performance then commences reversal,
become flux, slow and die. Remember when
you woke up yesterday, you felt alive,
energetic, went about with your day's chores
or tasks but there came a time the mind and
body began to feel weak and less agile, till you
slowed everything and went to bed. You were
tired. That is normal.
											</p>
                                            
											<p>
                                                In life such cycle seems to be a fact. The
question is; are you ready to retire or be
retired? One of my mentors told me that
young man as you step into this office
immediately begin to plan leaving the
same. This was true wisdom!
Ever thought why people everywhere
agree that there is a certain age and stage
in life that one must work and then stop.
They talk of efficiencies at the workplace. A
debate rages even today about whether a
pastor can say I am now ‘tired’ so am
stepping aside to focus on tasks that a
tired person can only do. Others see it
unimaginable that a pastor can be forced
to retire. This is especially said by those
who believe only in full-time Ministry,
giving up the vocational to only serve the
Lord - to avoid serving two masters, God
and Mammon.
                                            </p>
										
		<h4>Our reality
        </h4>									
	<p>I think our theologies contribute much to
        our state of affairs today. This is about our
        views on money, wealth, work, rest and
        the world generally which knowingly or
        unknowingly influences our choices and
        actions in life.
        Many times we have heard reports of
        pastors collapsing at the pulpit, or on their
        way down from the pulpit, or right in front
        of everyone.
        Today we have cases of pastors who think
        it is evil to listen to their bodies, abuse the
        flesh till the flesh gives up on them –
        forcing retirement. A few statistics indicate pastors committing suicide while
        mental health is fast becoming a
        thorn in the flesh for church
        workers. Some don't even believe
        in conventional medicine and only
        believe prayer alone is what God
        has ordained as means to ensure
        health. Sadly, the reality is that
        many suffer silently till death and
        the slogan "nguva yaMwari yanga
        yakwana" (God’s time had come) is
        echoed everywhere yet scripture
        talks of full life beyond 70 years.
        With poor job security in
        Zimbabwe, high formal
        unemployment and
        underemployment in the informal
        sector, it is not guaranteed that
        you will still earn that pay, salary
        or allowance from church as the
        sheep are not producing any milk.
        Since the days of COVID-19 many
        churches have struggled to raise
        money through tithes and
        offerings. Chenjerai kukama
        mombe kusvika kwakungobuda
        ropa chete (Be careful to avoid
        milking until only blood oozes).
        Here you here some pastors citing
        the widow of Zarephath case and
        not the widow of one of the
        prophets case.
         </p>
<h4>
    Unique features of the work:
Leadership style

</h4>        
<p>
    The church leadership style is
    consultative and office bearers
    are so humble. Their humility is
    the hallmark of the church’s
    growth. Leaders respect senior
    pastors through various ways
    such as tasking them to
    introduce speakers at regional,
    national events as well as
    closing events with prayers.
    The profiling of ministry is
    something that one cannot fail
    to notice. Nobody goes to the
    stage unless they have specific
    tasks to perform. That way, one
    can hardly notice who the
    leaders, i.e. chairman of the
    Regional council is or even who
    the members of the team.
    Currently, Pastor Mamba is the
    regional chairman. He sometimes leads by
    absence. When anyone thinks
    he will go up to say something
    he delegates or is strategically
    not at that point. Such aspects
    seem to advance missionary
    servant-hood!
    
</p>
<p>
    Today, there are no more cities of
the Priests and Levites except monastries run by a few mainline churches.
Yes Paul had a right like we do (servants of
the altar), yet this was not absolute. In fact
he argues that he didn't claim lest some
may be offended with the money thing in
church, as many surely do today. Money as
it is needed to answer all things, has
become a stumbling block for the poor and
vulnerable.
We have pastors today who refuse to be
assigned to a new local church outside the
cities and towns. It's because apart from
earning through tithe and offering, most
don't want to use other skills and talents.
Some hold on to the teaching that store
your treasure in spiritual terms and not on
earthly things yet the main emphasis of that
teaching seem ignored. Church
administration systems must look at this
area and empower pastors to prepare for
retirement, but much more this period
before one turns 55 or 65.

                                        </h4>
                                        <p>  Don't just think of income, think about your
                                            body, your health and act accordingly. Our
                                            Zimbabwean musical hero Oliver Mutukudzi
                                            (aka Tuku) sang the track "mupfumi ndiyani"
                                            (Who is rich?) messaging that mupfumi
                                            ndiye uyo ane hutano (the rich is one who is
                                            healthy). As our bodies are the temple of
                                            the Holy Spirit, we must pay attention to live
                                            healthy lifestyles watching how and what we
                                            eat as well as having frequent bodily
                                            exercises, this Apostle Paul affirms as
                                            beneficial/profitable. Let us not just exercise
                                            our tongue and jaws while eating but as well
                                            our muscles and flex the joints too. You may
                                            still be fervent in Spirit but can't do much
                                            when your body is frail! Even if we give you
                                            one more mountain, you may not even be
                                            able to clear the land yourself. Maybe for a
                                            legacy project, yes. Pastor, find time to walk
                                            around, jog, do the press-ups, or skip the
                                            rope. It's part of investing in retirement. I
                                            have also learnt to say NO to some
                                            invitations to minister or serve, especially
                                            when my body tells me so. Life expectancy
                                            is Zimbabwe is said to be under 40 years,
                                            think about it. There is a time for everything!
                                            Think about this reality. As we think so we
                                            become. Instead of being shocked with the
                                            thought of a time when you can't work to
                                            earn, instead, embrace it and plan for it.

<h4>
    Real story
</h4>
<p>
    
    There was a time in my working episode
    that I used to get airtime and fuel allowance
    every week, which oftentimes I didn't
    exhaust before the next signing. I could call
    anyone anytime, and travel anywhere
    without stress. I got used to this and
    adjusted my lifestyle accordingly. Ever heard
    that there is never a time money is enough?
    But a time came when all this was gone, you
    can imagine the discomfort, anxiety and
    frustration.
    I used to drive different vehicles associated
    with wealthy persons and yet my personal
    car was a Honda Fit. It came a time that
    those nice off-roads had to be taken away, it
    was Honda Fit's time. Thank goodness I had
    the Honda Fit, imagine if I didn't own this
    small car. Back to public transport – kombi,
    mushikashika and all right?
    My point is think, plan and act regarding
    how life will be when you are no longer
    doing that job or getting that monthly pay.

                                        <p>
                                            Even when one has been formally employed
and paying pension contributions, the
volatile economy will humble you. The
monthly pay-out today is how much
compared to cost of living monthly? You
cannot bank on this. Worse, most churches
don't follow labour laws and most pastors
don't have pension even. Saka uchaita sei?
(So, what shall you do?)You need another
income avenue.
While you still can earn it, think of the dry
season ahead (retirement).
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Real Story</h4>
										<p>
                                            Like Joseph (the second in command in
Egypt at one point the greatest civilisations),
during the days of good earning, I realised
my contract will not be renewed even
though I loved my job. I recalled my passion and interests that were elsewhere,
in farming. So my wife and I
managed to secure a small piece of
land, fenced it, build a decent
cottage, drilled a borehole,
constructed house for broilers and a
shed-net greenhouse from savings.
It was not a roller-coaster. First
drilling produced a dry hole, more
than a thousand United States
dollars lost in a moment. Still, we
drilled again after a while. Sometime
later, we thought of introducing
piggery, built the pigsty and later
secured breeding stock. This
definitely was not a short-term
project, we were preparing for the
long haul.
I invested in knowledge and became
hands-on while still formally
employed. When it was time to go,
at least the projects could self
sustain. We had assets that could be
monetized to cover the years of
unemployment. For me actually it
was about seventeen months
jobless, no income coming. </p>
<h4>Invest in a saving culture</h4>
                             <P>
                                Saving money and not enjoying it
through consumption is not easy
but if you have a goal, you endure
all the self-denials of leisure and
shopping and traveling. No matter
how small your income currently is
a pastor, learn to save money.
Those gifts, “sown seeds” and
allowances should be saved. Saving
is not keeping the remainder but
making an intentional act of
removing and saving a certain
amount. These days it’s not best to
put money under the pillow,
consider an asset to buy and store
value. Please buying a car is not
saving, most cars depreciate value
fast. As part of saving, learn to live within your means, the remaining
income. Don’t compare yourself with
another pastor or family

									<h4>Invest in your spouse</h4>
                                    <p>I am so grateful that my spouse is not
                                        a lazy person but very intelligent and
                                        diligent. Young people, when thinking
                                        of marriage, calculate well and ensure
                                        your loved one is not lazy. Haisingori
                                        yemafeatures and feelings nyaya iyi
                                        (It’s not about body features and
                                        beauty). Two are better than one in
                                        many respects. Some pastors don’t
                                        allow their wives to do any work or
                                        selling, hanzi zvinodzikisira hufundisi
                                        hwavo, shuwa here? (They say it
                                        belittles their pastoral status. Is it so?)
                                        Today the tide is no longer easy for
                                        man to be sole breadwinners, those
                                        days are long gone. Invest in your
                                        spouse, let them learn and earn. We
                                        need the Priscila and Aquila of today.
                                        Like Apostle Paul, he provided for his
                                        needs and those around him from his
                                        tent-making project/business/skill so
                                        that he never became spiteful for
                                        those churches who didn't support
                                        him materially/financially.
                                        Even if you are a pastor, as gifted as
                                        you are, you don't have daytime alltime.
                                        Imagine a pastor being a farmer, a
                                        marketer, an entrepreneur as well as
                                        a community resource? Surely you
                                        won't starve. Your family won't curse
                                        your G-d or Ministry. I know in my
                                        church movement, many pastors are
                                        now overdue retirement as per labour
                                        laws in the country but it's a sad state
                                        to see very few who own any
                                        property, or have a thriving income
                                        generation venture or with social
                                        capital that can catapult them from
                                        suffering. Life expectancy is
                                        Zimbabwe is said to be under 40
                                        years, think about it.Even my favourite
                                        poet spoke about the age of 25 as normal stage in life for one to live
                                        independently and sustainably, yet
                                        alas it is not so anymore. He still has
                                        dreams, so he encourages us all to
                                        never give up.
                                        Be shrewd with your time, talent and
                                        talents.
                                        </p>
								<h4> Conclusion</h4>
								<p>
									Human beings are designed to function effectively during
the day while most animals thrive at night. The Lord
knew this wisdom, that night will soon come, so He had
to do most if not all of His assignment before He was
arrested and killed in Jerusalem (night time came) "I must
work while it is still day...". As the famous sons of
Issachar, everyone needs this gift and wisdom to know
the times and what one must do. Indeed, it is about
knowing the existence of evil days so you place yourself
to redeem the time. You may be young but that doesn't
last forever. You may be old but there is yet another level
of older till being the oldest.
If you have been insulted by this piece, am sorry, it wasn’t
the aim. If you found this challenging, you are the right
person to have read this piece!
