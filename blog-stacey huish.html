									<h5>Introduction</h5>
									<p>As followers of Christ, 
                                        we should partner 
                                        with God to live in 
                                        our promised land. 
                                        God called us into a promised land. 
                                        There is a divine plan and promise 
                                        for our lives.
                                        There are 2.3 billion Christians in 
                                        the world, and yet most of them 
                                        still live in poverty. People living in 
                                        first world countries like Australia 
                                        are still living from pay check to pay 
                                        check. It just takes one financial 
                                        disaster and they are doomed. 
                                        How can we see a greater reflection 
                                        of God in our daily lives? When 
                                        Jesus taught His disciples to 
                                        pray, He encouraged them to ask, 
                                        “Your Kingdom come, your will be 
                                        done, on earth as it is in heaven” 
                                        (Matthew 6:10). So, we know God’s 
                                        will is for the culture of heaven to 
                                        invade earth. We should therefore 
                                        partner with God to make that 
                                        prayer a reality.

                                        <p>
                                            Unfortunately, I think the lack of 
global Christian influence indicates 
that we’ve misinterpreted how to follow the will of God for our lives. 
Again, there are many ways we 
have done this— “all have sinned, 
and come short of the glory of God.” 
(Romans 3:23)
In this article, I focus on how 
Christians have misinterpreted 
God’s intention for their finances, 
specifically in their giving. First, we 
will discuss what a manna mindset 
is in the context of the Israelites 
and the Promised Land. Then, we 
will discuss two types of money—
devotional and transactional—and 
the negative impact the latter has 
made in developing countries. 
Lastly, you will learn how to use 
your transactional money to 
make a sustainable difference for 
the Kingdom of God with the 7 
mountains of influence.

												<h6>
                                                    Manna Mindset</h6>
<p>We can learn a lot about God’s 
    will for our lives from studying the 
    Israelites’ journey into the Promised 
    Land in the Old Testament. The Book of Exodus details how God 
    miraculously rescued the Israelites 
    out from slavery in Egypt. Just a few 
    days into their journey, however, 
    the Israelites got hungry and 
    focused on the negative: “And the 
    whole congregation of the people 
    grumbled against Moses and Aaron 
    in the wilderness, and the people of 
    Israel said to them, “Would that we 
    had died by the hand of the Lord in 
    the land of Egypt, when we sat by 
    the meat pots and ate bread to the 
    full, for you have brought us out 
    into this wilderness to kill the whole 
    assembly with hunger.” (Exodus 
    16:2-3)
    God was angered by their 
    complaining. In his kindness, He 
    proved how faithful, kind, and 
    trustworthy He was by raining 
    down bread from heaven that tasted 
    like wafers with honey. They called 
    it manna. This happened every 
    day (except the Sabbath) that the 
    Israelites were in the wilderness for the entire 40 years!
    The manna was undoubtedly a 
    miracle. However, I don’t think 
    it represented the full measure of 
    His plans for His people. It was a 
    stepping stone to something greater. 
    For a God who created every food 
    in existence, manna was the minor 
    leagues. Can you imagine surviving 
    off of wafer crackers for 40 years?
    However, God in all His wisdom 
    knew that manna was what the 
    Israelites needed at the time. I don’t 
    think they were equipped in their 
    mindset to handle a bigger blessing 
    yet. Their journey to the Promised 
    Land was a time where God refined 
    their trust and obedience. He had 
    to ‘get the Egypt out of them,’ so to 
    speak—a little hunger made them 
    wish they were slaves again! (Before 
    you judge them, how often do we 
    crave the captivity of comfort over 
    God’s will for our lives?)
    So, a manna mindset is based on 
    spiritual immaturity. Someone 
    with a manna mindset constantly 
    asks, “Are you there, God? If so, 
    prove it!” It’s okay to start here. We 
    all do. However, we all reflect the 
    image of God, our Provider, too. As 
    we grow in spiritual maturity, He 
    moves us out of a manna mentality 
    so we can provide for others like 
    He does. When you move out of a 
    manna mentality, you become a 
    producer, not just a consumer. In 
    the following passage, you will see 
    how the Israelites underwent this 
    process.

												<h6>The Produce of Land</h6>
												<p>
                                                    “While the people of Israel were 
                                                    encamped at Gilgal, they kept the 
                                                    Passover on the fourteenth day of 
                                                    the month in the evening on the 
                                                    plains of Jericho. And the day after 
                                                    the Passover, on that very day, 
                                                    they ate the produce of the land, 
                                                    unleavened cakes, and parched 
                                                    grain. And the manna ceased the 
                                                    day after they ate the produce of the 
                                                    land. There was no longer manna 
                                                    for the people of Israel, but they ate 
                                                    the fruit of the land of Canaan that 
                                                    year.” (Joshua 5:10-12)
                                                    This passage shows revelation. The 
                                                    Israelites’ 40-year journey through 
                                                    the wilderness and into the Promised 
                                                    Land was over. They made it. Their 
                                                    new season was initiated by eating 
                                                    produce from their new home. Now 
                                                    they didn’t eat crackers that tasted 
                                                    like honey—they built houses in a 
                                                    land that was flowing with it! (Deut. 
                                                    31:20) 
                                                    The meal signified two things: the 
                                                    fulfilment of God’s promise, and the 
                                                    Israelites spiritual growth.
                                                    After a time of testing in the 
                                                    wilderness, God had brought the 
                                                    Israelites to a point of spiritual 
                                                    maturity. Now, they were ready to 
                                                    build something with Him rather 
                                                    than solely receiving. Now that they 
                                                    were in the Promised Land, they 
                                                    didn’t need manna anymore. They 
                                                    could cultivate their own gardens, 
                                                    raise their own livestock, and serve at their own tables. Getting the 
                                                    Israelites to the Promised Land 
                                                    wasn’t the end of the story–it was 
                                                    just the beginning.

											<h6>The Promised Land</h6>
											<p>God has called us into a Promised 
                                                Land. There is a divine plan and 
                                                promise for our lives, and just like 
                                                the Israelites, there will be a time 
                                                of testing and wandering as well. 
                                                While we seek out God’s calling 
                                                for our lives, we need to wait and 
                                                develop our characters. There will 
                                                be seasons where we are more 
                                                dependent on God’s daily provision 
                                                than others. However, God’s will for 
                                                our lives is for us to graduate beyond 
                                                manna—that we would learn to obey 
                                                and trust Him in the wilderness so 
                                                that we can prosper in the land that 
                                                He has for us.
                                                Getting to the Promised Land is 
                                                essential for receiving the promise. 
                                                However, we can’t continue to 
                                                wander and feel entitled to manna 
                                                as our birthright. The manna isn’t 
                                                the birthright, it’s an appetizer. 
                                                The land is the inheritance–the 
                                                main course. When Jesus said, “the 
                                                Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,” 
                                                (Matthew 4:17) it meant that part 
                                                of our inheritance is activated now Being saved and redeemed in 
                                                Christ means that we get to share 
                                                in the vision God has for the world 
                                                and partner as His stewards and 
                                                representatives.
                                                God dropping gifts onto our laps is 
                                                not the extent of heavenly wealth. 
                                                We are called to create environments 
                                                that serve as an invitation for others 
                                                to taste and see that the Lord is 
                                                good. We are commissioned to do 
                                                as God did. Not only to reap from 
                                                the harvest of our work, but to plant 
                                                and feed God’s sheep–the people 
                                                God loves, whether they know Him 
                                                yet or not.
                                                It’s nice to receive financial 
                                                miracles. They build our faith and 
                                                give us confidence that God is a 
                                                good Provider who is invested in 
                                                our lives. However, at some point 
                                                wouldn’t you like to be the one God 
                                                uses to bestow financial miracles?

											<h6>Devotional and Transactional 
                                                Money
											</h6>
											<p>Many Christians stay stuck in a 
                                                manna mindset their whole lives. 
                                                They see God as a provider who 
                                                rains down the occasional timely 
                                                blessing rather than a provider 
                                                who wants to partner with them to 
                                                build something sustainable. Their 
                                                view of their financial relationship 
                                                with God trickles into their giving. 
                                                Instead of using their generosity to 
                                                build something sustainable, they 
                                                use their generosity for sporadic 
                                                rather than strategic giving. Then, 
                                                the recipients of those blessings get stuck in a manna mindset as 
                                                well—commonly known as a welfare 
                                                mentality. Our giving doesn’t 
                                                empower others because we don’t 
                                                feel empowered by God. We can’t 
                                                give what we haven’t received.
                                                (It is important to note that this is 
                                                a general overview of how finances 
                                                typically work in Churches and 
                                                ministries. I definitely support 
                                                giving and tithing as the Holy Spirit 
                                                leads. However, I want to provide 
                                                a different roadmap as Christians 
                                                grow in their capacity to give.)
                                                Another way of describing this 
                                                trickle-down effect is through 
                                                examining the two types of 
                                                money people use for their giving: 
                                                devotional and transactional money.

or passive income.
One of the biggest structural issues 
in the Church today is that people 
don’t understand how money comes 
to them. This is true for a lot of 
church leaders who struggle to build 
the finances of their organization, 
but it’s true for a lot of congregants, 
too. Many people think that the 
devotional money they give will come 
back to them devotionally. However, 
I’ve found that God typically returns 
the devotional money we give back 
to us through transactional money. 
Let me explain.

There’s a common belief among the 
Christian faith about seed giving. To 
sum it up, when people give a seed 
faith offering, they believe God will 
multiply their money and return it 
to them. Preachers who call for a 
seed faith offering often quote from 
the parable of the Sower: “But those 
that were sown on the good soil are 
the ones who hear the word and 
accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold 
and sixtyfold and a hundredfold,” 
(Mark 4:20.) The first issue with 
this is that the verse isn’t necessarily 
referring to a financial return. Jesus 
is talking about spiritual fruitfulness. 
However, many people think that 
after they give, their money will 
come back to them devotionally. In 
other words, they think someone 
will randomly hand them $100 or 
they’ll receive an anonymous check 
in the mail.
Sometimes we expect a harvest 
without doing the hard work of 
tilling the soil. The reality is that 
we have to work the land that God 
has given us if we want a return! 
God often blesses us transactionally 
through the work He has called us 
to do. It could be a bonus at work or 
the growth of our business. As in, we 
sow into someone else’s Kingdom 
work with our giving and then God 
blesses the Kingdom work we do, 
too, so there is a continual flow 
between the Body of redeeming and 
perfection God’s world.
                                                    </p>
                                                </ul>
										</li>
										
                                    </ol>
											<h4>How does this Mindset Affect our Mission</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                In the past, there has been too much 
devotional money poured into 
overseas missions that has crippled 
economies. In her book, ‘Dead Aid’, 
Dambisa Moyo, Ph.D., reveals that 
over US$1 trillion in developmentalrelated aid has been transferred 
from rich countries to Africa. She 
writes, “In fact, the recipients of 
this aid are worse off; much worse 
off. Aid has helped make the poor 
poorer, and growth slower. Yet aid 
remains a centrepiece of today’s 
development policy and one of the 
biggest ideas of our time.”
People have given billions of 
dollars, but they haven’t created 
an equivalent number of systems 
to sustain and direct that money. 
People often throw $100 to 
missions they know nothing about. 
That’s why it’s so powerful when a 
Christian becomes financially free. 
When you learn how to build wealth 
through consistent passive income, 
not only do you have an abundance 
of resources to give away—you have 
enough to substantially change the 
systems that cause poverty, pain, 
and injustice. Because financial 
freedom provides you with enough 
income to quit your job if you’d like, 
you have an abundance of time to 
allocate towards developing your

												God showed me what He wants all of 
us to do. God gave me the message 
to bring to you. Everybody can have 
passive income. All you need to do 
is to open an account, put money 
in, and receive 5% ROI every week. 
Then you can leave money in there 
or take money out. The choice is 
yours. God wants us to help create 
a better financial system for all 
people. An automated system to give 
you the life you have always wanted. 
To get you to the Promised Land. 
GOD wants us to empower people 
to build wealth and businesses that 
residually provide a positive impact 
to their communities. 
It’s the same concept as teaching a 
man to fish rather than giving him a 
fish. This is especially powerful when 
whole congregations participate. 
And for Christians, they are able 
to give back to their communities 
through transactional money as 
well. It’s the transactional money 
that has a truly transformational 
impact.

                                                Mountains of Influence
											</h6>
                                           
											<p>
												Every country has needs. There are 
systems that need to be reformed 
and marginalized people that need help. At the mention of this, a specific 
cause probably comes to your mind 
or pulls on your heartstrings. If 
you’re following God, He will share 
His dreams with you. He will speak 
to you about the world He wants to 
create, and He will show you what 
role you play in that grand design. 
Then, He will give you people to 
run with and wisdom to see the 
vision through. It’s a wonderful 
partnership. I believe this is how we 
bring God’s Kingdom to Earth in a 
tangible way like Matthew 6:10 says.
I was drawn to reform business, 
but there are several other spheres 
of influence in society that may 
speak to you. The 7 Mountains of 
Influence is a paradigm for thinking 
about how we can partner with God 
to bring heaven to earth. Essentially, 
the 7 Mountains of Influence are 
the main areas that impact culture: 
government, business, education, 
family, media, religion, and arts.
Money is a necessity in every 
mountain. Redeeming society 
isn’t cheap, and there are spiritual 
forces of darkness that are trying 
to keep Christian influence out of 
culture (Ephesians 6:12). The cost 
includes money, but it goes beyond 
that as well (after all, Jesus died 
on the cross for it.) We honour His 
sacrifice and live in His example by 
dying to our own self and dedicating 
our time, energy, and finances. 
You’re not going to drift to the top 
of the mountain. You have to be 
intentional about what God wants 
to do in your life.

to. Begin to build wealth through investing your finances and 
building passive income.

                                            <br>

                                            <li>
										
                                                
                                                    Third: Learn how to give out 
                                                    of your wealth rather than your 
                                                    income. In other words, give more 
                                                    than 10%. Once you build enough 
                                                    passive income to pay for your cost 
                                                    of living, you’ll be financially free. 
                                                    At this point, you can give 100% of 
                                                    your excess away. 
                                                </li>
                                                <br>

                                                <li>
										
                                                    
                                                        Forth: Enter into your Promised 
Land. Use your wealth, experience, 
and time to climb to the top of the mountain God has called 
you to reform. At this stage, you 
partner with people who are on 
a similar mission. You’re able to 
use your transactional money to 
produce transactional money for 
the Kingdom

									<h4> Conclusion</h4>
									<p>
										The result will be 
transformational; a system that 
produces spiritual fruit over and 
over again. Imagine what the 
world will look like in the coming 
generations if Christians start 
thinking this way!
