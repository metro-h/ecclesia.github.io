                                        <h6> The Origins of Tithing</h6>
                                     
										<p>
											Tithing did not originate necessarily in the
Scriptures, but was a rampant practice in
most Middle Eastern cultures. This confuses
most people when they discover it. Biblical
tithing originated in the mind of a loving God
who ingrained it in the various cultures well
before the Bible was written.

											</p>
                                            <h6>Let us take a look at biblical tithing and
                                                see whether we have not confused
                                                matters.</h6>
											
										
											
	<p>Hebrews 7:1-11 says, “For this Melchizedek, king
        of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met
        Abraham returning from the slaughter of the
        kings and blessed him, and to him Abraham
        apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is
        first, by translation of his name, king of
        righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem,
        that is, king of peace. He is without father or
        mother or genealogy, having neither beginning
        of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son
        of God he continues a priest forever. See how
        great this man was to whom Abraham the
        patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils! And those
        descendants of Levi who receive the priestly
        office have a commandment in the law to take
        tithes from the people, that is, from their
        brothers, though these also are descended from
        Abraham. But this man who does not have his
        descent from them received tithes from
        Abraham and blessed him who had the
        promises. It is beyond dispute that the inferior is
        blessed by the superior. In the one case tithes
        are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that he
        lives. One might even say that Levi himself, who
        receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, for he
        was still in the loins of his ancestor when
        Melchizedek met him. Therefore if perfection were
        through the Levitical priesthood for under it the
        people received the law, what further need would
        we have for another priest according to the order of
        Melchizedek who is not called according to the
        order of Aaron.”
        This Scripture is a great launching pad for
        understanding tithing. We have often viewed
        tithing within the wrong context. Hebrews takes
        the discussion of tithing to the context of the
        beginning in Genesis 14 and places it within the
        context of the priesthood.
        In reality his argument implies that tithing is
        intrinsically linked to the priesthood. The Bible
        teaches that there are two lines of priesthood,
        namely the priests according to the order of
        Aaron or commonly called the Levitical
        priesthood and the priesthood according to the
        order of Melchizedek.
        Scripture teaches us that the Levitical priests
        were mandated by the Law to collect the tithe
        from their brethren. The priesthood according to
        the order of Aaron was appointed by inheritance
        by being born into the tribe of Levi. It was
        through this priesthood that the Law was
        introduced to people during the time of Moses.
        This priesthood was subject to death and so was
        temporal. The Bible calls it an imperfect
        priesthood. It is clear that the Levitical tithing
        system is introduced and exercised within the
        context of the Mosaic Law.

                                        <p>  One priest receives the tithes here on earth while
                                            the other receives the tithe in heaven. These
                                            tithing systems are also different. For good
                                            measure the Scriptures state that the Order of
                                            Aaron (Levitical priesthood) is subservient to the
                                            Order of Melchizedek as Levi paid the tithe to
                                            Melchizedek (Jesus Christ) through Abraham.
                                            For the avoidance of doubt there are two
                                            priesthoods here namely i) Order of Aaron – the
                                            imperfect priesthood of Levi who minister at the
                                            tabernacle of Moses and ii) Order of
                                            Melchizedek – the eternal (or perfect)
                                            priesthood of Jesus Christ who minister on the
                                            tabernacle of David.
                                            To understand the second priesthood let us
                                            move on to Hebrews 7:12-24 (MEV) which says
                                            “For the priesthood being changed of necessity there
                                            is also a change of law. For He of whom these things
                                            are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no
                                            man officiates at the altar, for it is evident that our
                                            Lord arose from the tribe of Judah of which Moses
                                            did not speak anything concerning the priesthood.
                                            And yet it is more evident if in the likeness of
                                            Melchizedek there arises another priest who has
                                            come not according to the law of the flesh but
                                            according to the power of an endless life. For He
                                            testifies: You are a priest forever in the order of
                                            Melchizedek. For there is an annulling of the
                                            previous commandment due to its weakness and
                                            uselessness. For the law made nothing perfect, but
                                            now a better hope is introduced, by which we draw
                                            near to God. And He was not made a priest without
                                            an oath. (Other priests were made without an oath,
                                            but this One with an oath by the One who said to
                                            Him: The Lord has sworn and will not relent, you are
                                            a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.
                                            Through this oath Jesus became the guarantor of a
                                            better covenant. And the former priests were
                                            numerous because they were hindered from serving
                                            because of death. But He, because He lives forever,
                                            has an everlasting priesthood”                                                                                      
</p>

										<p>
                                            Hebrews declares that there was a change of
priesthood and a tribe that did not inherit
priesthood, the tribe of kings was now allowed
access to the priesthood. This is the priestly
order of Melchizedek. Jesus Christ came and
operated under the priesthood in the order of
Melchizedek.
A change in priesthood necessitates a change of law. Again we see two different sets of
laws: the Law of Moses and the law of Christ. It clearly says that there is a change of law
because of the change of priesthood.
The second priesthood is linked to Melchizedek who had no known genealogy or
parentage. This would immediately disqualify him for being a priest under the Levitical
system because one had to prove their lineage to Levi to qualify.
Hebrews tells us that Jesus Christ is the High Priest of the priesthood of the order of
Melchizedek. Jesus, the lion of the tribe of Judah, descends from the tribe of Judah of
which Moses never said anything about the priesthood. What this means is that the
priesthood of Melchizedek is not governed by the Law of Moses. In actual fact this
priesthood predates the priesthood of Aaron. When God introduced the concept of priests
he started with the priesthood of the order of Melchizedek in Genesis 14.
Abraham’s response to being introduced to the priesthood of the order of Melchizedek,
was to bring a tithe. Notice thatthere are two priestly lines – Order of Levi which is earthly
and temporal but received tithes according to the Law and order of Melchizedek which is
heavenly and eternal. This priestly line received tithes from the Abraham.

                                        <h4> Tithing System</h4>
                                        <p>The Levitical tithing prescribed by the Law and linked to the Law of Moses and the
                                            Abrahamic tithing which is the first and original tithe introduced by God.
                                            Let us follow these two tithing systems and study what they are made up of.

                                                    </h6>
                                                    <p>This tithing system was introduced and governed by the Mosaic Law. The sons of Levi
                                                        were responsible for collecting this tithe. It was a three–tithe system as described below:
                                                        Tithe 1: Levite Tithe – Often called the lord’s tithe, it consisted of 10% of all annual
                                                        agricultural produce, flocks and cattle which was used to support the priests and Levites
                                                        since they were given no inheritance of land. Numbers 18:21, 24 says, “I have given the
                                                        children of Levi, all the tithes in Israel for an inheritance, for their service, which they
                                                        serve, even the service of the tent of meeting. --- But the tithes of the children of Israel,
                                                        which they offer as an offering to the Lord, I have given to the Levites to inherit. Therefore
                                                        I have said to them, among the children of Israel, they will have no inheritance.”
                                                        Leviticus 27:30-34 says, “A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or
                                                        fruit from the trees, belongs to the Lord, it is holy to the Lord. If the man redeems any of
                                                        his tithe, he must add a fifth of its value to it. The entire tithe of the herd and flock- every
                                                        tenth animal that passes under the shepherd’s rod- will be holy to the Lord. He must no
                                                        pick out the good from the bad or make any substitution. If he does make a substitution
                                                        both the animal and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.”
                                                        This tithe was by commandment and a heavy penalty for failing to pay the tithe on time.
                                                        The Levites were also required to take a tithe from their income – from the tithes they
                                                        received- and tithe to God. This is the tithe that is referred to in Malachi 3:10. God was
                                                        complaining about the priests who had robbed him and failed to give God the tithe of
                                                        their own income.</p>

                                                    <p>Festival Tithe – The second tithe on the remaining 90% was an additional
                                                        tithe that the people consumed themselves each year at the Feast of Tabernacles in a
                                                        nationwide celebration of God’s provision in God’s Presence.
                                                        Unlike the use of first tithe, however, God designates second
tithe for personal use during His festivals. Please note that
they were to share with the Levites.
Deuteronomy 12:5-7 “But you are to seek the place the Lord
your God will choose from among all your tribes to put His
Name there for His dwelling. To that place you must go, there
bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special
gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings
and the firstborn of our herds and flocks. There in the presence
of the Lord your God, you and your families shall eat and shall
rejoice in everything you have put your hand to because the
Lord your God has blessed you.”
Deuteronomy 12:17-19 clearly shows that they were not to
eat the tithe within their gates but in the presence of the
Lord and they were to include the Levites in this.
Deuteronomy 14:22-27, “Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that
your fields produce each year. Eat the tithe of your grain, new
wine and oil and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the
presence of the Lord your God in the place he will choose as
a dwelling place for his Name, so that you may learn to revere
the Lord your God always. But if that place is too distant and
you have been blessed by the Lord your God and you cannot
carry your tithe (because the place where the Lord will choose to
put His Name is so far away), then exchange your tithe for silver
and take the silver with you and go to the place the Lord your
God will choose. Use the silver to buy whatever you like, cattle,
sheep, wine or other fermented drink or anything you wish. Then
you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the
Lord your God and rejoice. And do not neglect the Levites living
in your towns, for they have no allotment or inheritance of their
own.</p>

                                                    </h6>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Charity Tithe – Unlike the other two tithes, this one
was to be offered once every three years. Its primary
purpose was to take care of the aliens, the poor and the
Levites. It was not taken to the temple but stored in their
towns.
Deuteronomy 14:28 “At the end of every three years, bring all
the tithes of that year’s produce and store it in your towns, so
that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their
own) and the aliens, the fatherless and the widows who live in
your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the
Lord your God may bless you in the work of your hands.”
Clearly the Levitical tithes and the entire Levitical priestly
order are based on the covenant of the Mosaic Law. With
this understanding, let’s consider the popular text on tithing
namely Malachi 3:10-11, “Bring all the tithes into the
storehouse, that there may be food in My House, and test
Me now in this, says the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open for
you the windows of Heaven and pour out for you blessing,
that there will not be room enough to receive it.”
There are a few challenges with a literal reading of this
Scripture for a new covenant believer. This text is written
primarily to the Levitical priests and refers to the Levitical
tithe. It refers to blessings being poured out through open
windows of heaven, implying that the recipient is outside.
However the New Testament positions us as having been
invited and seated together with Christ in heavenly places. If
you are being fed through windows then you are operating
outside the heavenly sanctuary. Levitical priests were
outside. Jesus paid the price to bring us in. We are seated in
heavenly places with Christ. (Ephesians 2:5-6 ESV).
Furthermore in the New Testament God opens doors and
not windows. Doors for us to enter. We are not outsiders but
insiders. We are blessed with all spiritual blessings in
heavenly places. (“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord

                                                    </p>
                                                </li>
                                            </ol>


										
																			<blockquote class="overlay">
											<p>Aliquam nec lacus pulvinar, laoreet dolor quis, pellentesque ante. Cras nulla orci, pharetra at dictum consequat, pretium pretium nulla. Suspendisse porttitor nunc a sodales tempor. Mauris sed felis maximus, interdum metus vel, tincidunt diam. Nam ac risus vitae sem vehicula egestas. Sed velit nulla, viverra non commodo et, sodales</p>					
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places”, Ephesians 1:3 ESV)
The next challenge is that a curse is placed on non-tithers. However, Galatians 3:13-14 (ESV) clearly declares that
“Christ became a curse for us”. He took the curse of the Law. We are blessed together with faithful Abraham. I am
not cursed but I am blessed in Christ. God is not in the business of cursing people. So according to Malachi 3, people
tithe because of fear of being cursed. It is not based on faith.
										</p>
									
								<h4> Conclusion</h4>
								<p>
									The New Testament principle is clear: Whatever is not of faith is sin! I do not tithe out of fear!
Another concern with Malachi 3 is that God “promises” to pour out a blessing that I cannot contain or have the
capacity to contain. So it’s a limited blessing like too much rain that just washes off the ground without soaking in to
have any benefit to the ground. There was no structure under the Levitical priesthood that could contain the fullness
of God’s blessing. Yet the testimony of the New Testament is that I have enough capacity in Christ to receive the
fullness of the Abrahamic blessing. There is enough room in my life for God’s blessing. To be accurate however, the
seven words in bold do not exist in the original. They were added by translators to amplify the meaning but in this
case they distort the meaning</p>
